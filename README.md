# AgentDS-Competition-Winning-Solution-in-Retail-Banking
This project tackles fraud detection and credit default prediction in retail banking using imbalanced data. Baseline models failed despite high accuracy, so I shifted to behavioral and temporal features with imbalance-aware learning. Final models achieved Macro-F1 of 0.5211 (fraud) and 0.9553 (default).
